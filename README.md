Swipe back in Google Chrome is a simple extension that
allows you to navigate back and forward in the browser history by swiping left or right on your touchpad.

## Motivation

On Ubuntu and maybe other Linux distributions, that run Gnome,
you can't navigate back and forward in the browser history by swiping left or right on your touchpad.

This is a feature that I really like and I missed it a lot, so I decided to create this extension.

> **Note:**
> I know you could possibly use some packages and configure them to make it work,
> but I wanted a simple solution that works out of the box.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clmmakdjojjcfjainblcjcglejkagkma).
2. Refresh all pages or restart the browser (otherwise the extension only works for new tabs).

## Usage

- Swipe left to navigate back.
- Swipe right to navigate forward.
